<p>Welcome to my Server Configuration Repository for Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS! This repository acts as a thorough manual and resource for configuring and fine-tuning an Ubuntu server so that it may function as a reliable and effective centre for a range of services. This repository offers comprehensive instructions and configurations designed to make the installation and configuration procedure as simple as possible, regardless of the task at hand—deploying a DNS server with bind9, administering DHCP configurations, setting up a secure firewall, or using a Squid proxy server.</p>

<h2>•	How to Install this Distro</h2>
<br/>
<p>For this setup, I used VMWare Workstation 17 and Ubuntu Server version 20.04.1. In order to install VMWare you can visit the download site for VMWare Worksation 17 here:</p>

</ul>
<p>The default configurations for VMWare should be perfectly fine. VMware is going to act as the foundation for hosting our Ubuntu Server.</p>
