<p>BIND 9 is a very flexible, full-featured DNS system. It is the most popular DNS server used today. Since we are going to set up a name server, Bind9 should be perfect since it easy to setup on Ubuntu.</p>
<h3>How to Install Bind9</h3>
<p>Enter the following command:</p>
<ul>
  <li>sudo apt install bind9</li>
</ul>
<h3>Configurations</h3>
<p>First edit the /etc/bind/named.conf.options file and change the default configurations to your DNS servers of your choosing. The default file looks like this, you want to change the 1.2.3.4; and 5.6.7.8;</p>

<p>Restart the DNS server using the command:</p>
<ul>
  <li>sudo systemctl restart bind9.service</li>
</ul>
<p>We should now setup the primary server for your domain. First we need to add a DNS zone to bind9. Edit the /etc/bind/named.conf.local file to change to include your chosen domain. </p>

<p>Next copy the existing zone file and use it to create a file for your new zone:
sudo cp /etc/bind/db.local /etc/bind/db.newzone.com </p>
<p>Edit the copy of the local file you made to change a couple things. Change localhost. to the domain of your server remember to leave the period at the end (newzone.com.). Next change 127.0.0.1 to the nameserverâ€™s address. Next change root.localhost to an email address but instead of an @ symbol, use a period here and another period at the end. We will create an A record to point your domain to an IP. Also make sure to create an A record for your name server.
It is good practice to increment the serial number every time you change the zone file.</p>
<p>Restart the DNS server again</p>
<p>Some admins may want to setup a Reverse Zone File so that DNS can resolve addresses to names. This configuration can be found here:
